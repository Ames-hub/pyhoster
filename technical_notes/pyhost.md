# PyHost extra information
These are simple "things to know" about pyhost.
I doubt this will be a big file, as its just tiny bits I may think are "Probably helpful to know for developers or users"<br>
Either that or they're just small comments about something. Especially errors that could be happening anywhere in pyhost.

## Exceptions on exit
No idea why these happen, if anyone can figure this out, Good bloody job.
And if you CAN figure it out, please do tell me or submit a pull request or an issue, anything.

## Backups system
Little is remembered about the system. If anyone can confront reading the code and probably figuring it out in a minute (because I know its not THAT complicated)<br>
It'd be greatly appreciated if you could update ./technical_notes/snapshot_system.md

## Userman -> ENTER function
No idea why the terminal's background goes black when this function is called.
I couldn't even BEGIN to guess why. I know I thought "Huh, it'd be cool if the background could have its colour changed" when I was making the function.
So PRESUMABLY, I did SOMETHING that I thought would do it and it worked, But now its a pain in the ass that I can't figure out!
If anyone knows what the hell is happening, Please help.
